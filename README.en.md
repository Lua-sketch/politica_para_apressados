## About
This website was created as a final project for the Global Fellowship at the Columbia Journal of Science, Technology, Ethics, and Policy (JSTEP). 
My goal was to make public data from the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies and Senate easier to navigate. Thus, Brazilian voters can better inform themselves about different deputies, 
senators and parties, and the general public can access bills of interest in a variety of topics (e.g. Human Rights and Minorities, Public Administration, Security and Defense, among others).

## Data
All data about bills proposed by deputies was obtained from the Open Data API of the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. Similarly, all data on bills proposed by senators comes from 
the Brazilian Senate's Open Data API.
