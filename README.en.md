# Pol√≠tica para Apressados (Politics for People in a Hurry)

## About
This site was created as a final project for the Global Fellowship at the Columbia Journal of Science, Technology, Ethics, and Policy (JSTEP). 
The goal is to make public data from the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies and Senate easier to navigate. Thus, voters can better inform themselves about different deputies, 
senators and parties, and the general public can access bills of interest in different topics.

## Data
All data about bills from deputies were obtained from the Open Data API of the Chamber of Deputies. Similarly, all data on bills proposed by senators comes from 
the Senate's Open Data API.
